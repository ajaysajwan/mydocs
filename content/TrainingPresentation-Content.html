GNU
Self-referentially, short for GNU's not UNIX, a UNIX-compatible software system developed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The philosophy behind GNU is to produce software that is non-proprietary. Anyone can download, modify and redistribute GNU software. The only restriction is that they cannot limit further redistribution. The GNU project was started in 1983 by Richard Stallman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

BASH
Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, that will appear in the GNU operating system. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).

Every clone is really a full backup of all the data

Git Has Integrity - Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum

The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming is called a SHA-1 hash
This is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters (0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git

modified - means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet
