GNU
Self-referentially, short for GNU's not UNIX, a UNIX-compatible software system developed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The philosophy behind GNU is to produce software that is non-proprietary. Anyone can download, modify and redistribute GNU software. The only restriction is that they cannot limit further redistribution. The GNU project was started in 1983 by Richard Stallman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

BASH
Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, that will appear in the GNU operating system. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).

VCS - Version Control System. It can be a Local or Centralized System
One of the more popular VCS tools was a system called RCS. Mac OS X operating system includes the rcs command when you install the Developer Tools

CVCS - Centralized Version Control System
DVCS - Distributed Version Control System
DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs)
clients donâ€™t just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the repository. Thus if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via it, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data
--- Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux

Snapshots, Not Differences
Nearly Every Operation Is Local
Git Has Integrity - Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum
